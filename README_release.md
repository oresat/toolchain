# Release Toolchain Notes

## Proposal: Use Launchpad GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain

* https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded
 * Choose specific version for all release versions

## Proposal: Create virtual machine or docker image to build objects for flash


## Proposal: Each Makefile should have a release target which undefines all DEBUG and DEVEL #ifdefs.
	
* This needs more discussion
